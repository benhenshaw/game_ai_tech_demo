# Level Generation for a Tile-Based Game
**for Game AI Programming**

Please read my [Report](https://github.com/benhenshaw/game_ai_tech_demo/blob/master/Report.md).

The file [level.c](https://github.com/benhenshaw/game_ai_tech_demo/blob/master/level.c) has the level generation code in it.
Although all of the code in the repo has been written by me, the files [common.c](https://github.com/benhenshaw/game_ai_tech_demo/blob/master/common.c), [editor.c](https://github.com/benhenshaw/game_ai_tech_demo/blob/master/editor.c), and [game](https://github.com/benhenshaw/game_ai_tech_demo/blob/master/game.c) have been submitted for other coursework and so should not be marked for this submission.
