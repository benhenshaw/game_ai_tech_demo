Please read my [Report](https://github.com/benhenshaw/game_ai_tech_demo/blob/master/Report.md).

And watch the [demo video](https://youtu.be/CLVmOceJYUs).

The file [level.c](https://github.com/benhenshaw/game_ai_tech_demo/blob/master/level.c) has the level generation code in it.</br>
You can build it using `cc level.c -o level`, and run it by typing `./level`.

Although all of the code in the repo has been written by me, the the files [common.c](https://github.com/benhenshaw/game_ai_tech_demo/blob/master/common.c), [editor.c](https://github.com/benhenshaw/game_ai_tech_demo/blob/master/editor.c), and [game.c](https://github.com/benhenshaw/game_ai_tech_demo/blob/master/game.c) have been submitted for other coursework and so should not be marked for this submission. The game that plays these levels is provided but is not part of the coursework.

The [sprite sheet](https://github.com/benhenshaw/game_ai_tech_demo/blob/master/sheet.bmp) is in the public domain.

To play the game, you will need [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/). The level generator can be run separately, and has no external dependencies.
